Today's the last day at home before I shift my base to Kolkata for a couple of months. It somehow feels I got less time at home,
just 4 days after 4 months, but that's how it is. No complains though, I knew beforehand about the pucity of time of time I will
be getting with friends, family and my tennis raquet. I am pretty sure it will be compensated by the learning and productivity at 
my summer internship at Quant One which is an algorithmic trading firm. 

So as the Summer of '17 sets in, I would like to see myself through the following goals by the end of it: 
1. Understanding algorithmic trading and functioning algorithmic trading as a whole, and contributing to the fullest during my 
brief stint at Quant One.
2. Raising money for BOSM'17. 
3. Raising partnerships for the Enactus project. 
4. Completing InterviewBit algorithms material. 
5. Running the half marathon on July 23rd under an hour and fifty five minutes.
6. Getting to know Kolkata as a city properly. I barely know any city, including Delhi; and that feels weird!

Let's see how it goes. Hopefully I will be striking off all of the points listed in the next two months. 

Will be posting weekly updates, stay tuned!
