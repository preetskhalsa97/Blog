Hello, folks!

Last three weeks at college have been quite intense. Spent most of the time juggling between classes and department recruitments
somehow ensuring that I am running regularly.

This semester is quite loaded academically, have 34 hours of coursework per week (screw you, dual degree)! What seemed an
opportunity to explore interests and build a multi- dimensional outlook towards the world ended up as a struggle to sail through
two degrees which I don't particularly like. Well, this semester I like only once course that is Digital Design. There's this huge 
debate inside the head all the time on whether I should slog for an irrelevant pointer.

Spoke to a LOT of people from the incoming batch. I was particularly impressed to witness how so many freshmen are open to step
out of their comfort zone and make the best of their time on campus. While recruiting, it was rather funny to realize that I
somehow still feel like a first year~ too many questions, too much to do, too less time and a drive to "figure it all out"! As
I lead the department with a colleague whose personality is quite contrasting to mine I am learning a lot about my leadership style,
how it's different from others I have worked with or under in the past, what kind of teams do I like to lead, what kind of projects
I like to lead and most importantly, helping me discover the hustler inside me who can work with a lot of other teams while
protecting the interests of my own team. 

Yes, we got ARSENAL on campus! Too much many logistical challenges (some of which continue to persist), but still worth it!
Football team is having a great time. Feels good to have somewhat contributed to the sporting culture on campus.

Finally back on the track. Been running regularly in the past two weeks. This week
