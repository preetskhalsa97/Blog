We finally got the backtester running, at least the simplest version.It was a bumpy ride though, too many bugs, dependency 
issues and biases for now!
Now on, it's gonna be really exciting. 

Okayish calling, have to find a way to improve. 

'Twas a hectic week for the legs, an 8 k run and a couple of 4 k runs. Legs hurting again though. Chances of a finish in the last 
August look bleak. Can't do much, no point over straining and then injuring. Let's see how this goes. 

The weekend was a lazy one, stayed indoors lamenting career choices. I admit it was overthinking, and a waste of prescous time. 

That's it for now!
