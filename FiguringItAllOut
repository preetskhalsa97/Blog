A lot of people spend countless hours in anxiety in the pursuit of figuring out what is it that they really want, what is it 
that set of things that will give meaning to existence.
I overthink a lot when it comes to this, often leading myself to more overthinking folowed by burnout and then getting myself
to try myself to do things that are logically sound. 
One question though silences all those doubts/ fears of not figuring out/ anxiety, asking yourself "What if I die before______?".
You suddenly know what to do, what is important and what is not.
Maybe, well maybe, it's drawn from the Nice experience...
