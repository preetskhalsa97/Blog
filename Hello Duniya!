Hola! 

I am a sophomore at BITS Pilani (at least until the semester results are out) on a quest to figure out my own definitions of the 
things around <information overload doesn't really help here!> and how I can best contribute to the current scheme of things. 

I'd like to think that I seek opportunities in the wrapper of inconvenience. A brief stint to find and solve important problems 
and self discovery has led me to appreciate the power of the contrarian truth, compassion, computing, big data, untapped markets
and human endurance. I will hopefully start a tech company and/ or an NGO sometime. Current aim is learning to build and sell.

In my free time <which is a LOT of time in college>, I like to play tennis, go for runs & long walks <you see, I am blessed with a 
serene campus!>, waste time brainstorming over complex hypothetical situations and chill with a lovely set of wingies.

Did I tell you I am pursuing a double major in EEE and Economics? Doesn't matter, I enjoy neither!

The reason for starting this blog is to talk (and hence, gain clarity) about my perspectives, experiences, ideas and thoughts <You 
know, they are best served candid!>. I commit to post weekly updates henceforth to stay accountable for my productivity. Hopefully
this blog will push me to develop the first complete website developed by myself.

Hit me up if you would like to discuss tennis, Rafael Nadal, big data, startups or anything that adds value to the current scheme 
of things.
