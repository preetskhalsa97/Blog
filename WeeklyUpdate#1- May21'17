This week was amazingly chill, as expected. Monday was particularly eventful, saw the disastrous compres end with OOP being the 
final nail in the coffin, a fantastic lunch @ pizzeria, crazy packing and (p)senti goodbyes. 

Returned home on Tuesday after quite some time, it's amazing to see how fast the younger one and the elder sweethearts back home 
are growing so fast. Rest of the week was spent catching up with friends over walks, movies and food. Guardians of the Galaxy II
is awesome!

A game of tennis with my tennis partner was an absolute delight. I wonder how on Earth do I get back in rhythem so quick when he 
is on the other side of the court, I was playing for the third time in the last six months!

Also, I spent some time reading and taking notes from "How to make you own algorithmic trading business" by Ernest P. Chan, as
instructed by the HR @ Quant One. The notes can be accessed @ https://github.com/preetskhalsa97/HowToBuildAlgoTradingBusiness.
It's a work in progress though, will mostly have to burn the midnight oil to complete it before joining tomorrow.

The last two days were mostly spent packing, travelling and hunting for a place to stay. Finally, I am settled in the cultural 
capital of India (yes, Kolkata!). It seems that I will have to struggle to find a decent place to run. 

We are close to getting the first deal for BOSM, so that's great. Another super- exciting deal is in the pipeline. This edition 
will be bigger than ever if we are able to pull it off, fingers crossed!

Running schedule suffered tremendously, you see I couldn't resist meeting all the long lost friends! Will start a two month 
routine on Nike Run Plus from tomorrow, and will stick to it.

Hopefully, the coming week will see loads of productivity @ office, some interesting algorithmic puzzles, kickass deals and
enthralling runs. That's about it for now!
