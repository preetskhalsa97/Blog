This week was all about getting started with the internship project and calling for BOSM. 

It was a productive week at the office, we were able to prototype a mean reversion strategy swiftly and it gave promising 
primilary results. We now have to generate backtester friendly data and get the strategy working on the platform. It was
fun brainstorming with the mentors. I am really looking forward to the analysis phase of the strategy. Too many hypotheis to 
test! Saturday though, was unproductive. Some confusing data format and the "Saturday syndrome" lead to unproductive lines of
code and a crappy movie on Saturday!! 

I stick to the running schedule, too much issue with the pace though. When will I be back to my top pace? :/ 

Calling was a bit rusty but the team is getting back to rhythem. I expect a couple of MOUs signed next week so that's a good
sign! :) 

Sunday was damn chill, went to Kushal bhaiya's place and had some awesome home cooked food. Waas lucky enough to meet a friend
of his who's a self made millionairre @ 23, #perspective.

On a side note, I will drop the personal goal of learning about Data structures and algorithms since I am already feeling the 
inability to give 100% to the two things I am ought to take to logical conclusion right now- my internship and raising 
sponsorship. 

Next week will see a more structured approach to productivity (all of my tasks are marying an excel sheet :P ), serious outputs
@ work, more disciplined calling & it's strategising and more importantly, longer runs. 

It's been a couple of weeks out here and I am missing home, missing tennis, learning to be on my own and falling in love with
this city, the work and excel sheets! That's about it for now.
