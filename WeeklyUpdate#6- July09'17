Hola folks!

It's almost been a month since the last entry, my bad! Gotta get back to the habit of reflecting every weekend.

This week was quite unproductive @ work. Debugging on Monday, analysis and more crucial debugging on Friday and waiting for 
the server to function in between. Wrote a doc though, "Welcome to the backtester" for new researchers so that they won't waste
time like we did, figuring out things just because they are new to the platform. We finally got a system to work on, and 
saw some interesting (yet disappointing) results on Friday. Some more things to be testednext week. I really wish we could stay 
further to work on the project. Now that the real fun has begun, it's time to leave. :/ 

Getting back to the running rhythem, thankfully recovered from the Garbhanga fatigue (remind me I have to write a blog on 
this!). Won't be able to run the marathon, will be able to touch the 10k mark within 55 minutes before the end of the 
vacation though. 
Took calling lite, will give 100% once the PS is over. 

Apart from that, spent countless hours being confused about career and shizz, concluding that the process of a highly planned
career ain't gonna work for me. I will give myself the liberty to connect the dots later sometime. Till then, the priority
is to learn, make an impact, do challenging stuff and not to get bored! For all I know, remainder of my BITSian life will be 
spent delving into tech that would solve real life problems. Given the kind of activities I have been involved in till now, 
next logical steps would be to do something in the non technical area, but there's a strong gut feeling to do otherwise. Let's
see where all of it leads to.

Next week is gonna be presentations, reports, documentation and some desperate attempts to try out the autocorrelation filter
and z score ranks to get something plausible. 

That's it for now!
